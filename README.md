# Introduction

This project focuses on seven types of search algorithms applied to a order sequence container implemented with array.

The functions are called on ranges defined over an sort array of integers. Therefore they receive foue parameters: three iterators (pointers) that define a half-closed interval for searching and a default iterator from one of pointers, [first;last), the value that are looking for, and the last. The function look to the full array, it won't find noone, because the ideia it's to look to the worst case from all algorithm, return last.
